A test file must define :
* A screen size context to execute always with the same screen size on every platforms (local, server...)
* A preference context to set all the default preferences
* A workbench context to open all the useful views and the perspective
* A workspace context to set the projects that must be opened...

Pay attention in tests:
* To not use coordinates check
* To not use Drag & Drop from the palette
* To not use Click on a tool in the palette + CTRL
* To call the object name and its container figure : get-edit-part -name "xxxObjectName" | get-edit-part -className SquareEditPart

Warning : remove the target folder after running the tests locally with maven 
else RCPTT complains about "duplicate IDs" and it would be impossible to relaunch tests suites.
