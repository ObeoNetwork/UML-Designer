h1. Features

h2. Class Diagram

h3. Support for Broken Associations

It might happen that for some reason you have an *Association* instance in your package which doesn't have the proper *ends*. In that case
the class diagram will show the broken associations as nodes :

!features/class_pics/broken association.JPG!

You can use the *Association* tools in the palette __(Association, Reference, Composition and Aggregation)__ to re-attach the Association to a classifier.

h3. Related Classes/Interface filtering and highlighting

You have two ways to highlight classes related to one given class. The first one is to activate the *Related filter* on the *Class Diagram*. It will hide elements (*Class*, *interface*, *Association*, ...) that are not related to the class you selected (context). The second way can be achive by using the *Related Classes Diagram*. This diagram will show all elements related to the selected class.

Lets use an instance to visualize the result of each methods. Consider the following model :

!features/class_pics/related classes/Related_classes_package.JPG!

By opening the *Class Diagram* on package1 you get the following diagram :

!features/class_pics/related classes/package_1_not_filtered.JPG!

You can then apply the filter on ContextClass :

!features/class_pics/related classes/activate_filter_on_ContextClass.JPG!

The resulting diagram will be as follow :

!features/class_pics/related classes/package_1_filtered_on_ContextClass.JPG!

Notice that only classes present in the initial diagram are present. If you want all classes related to ContextClass you should open the *Related Classes Diagram* on the ContextClass :

!features/class_pics/related classes/ContextClass_related_classes.JPG!

h3. Classes in SubComponents

A *Class Diagram* created on a Package or a Model will display the contained classes but also the classes which are contained in Components of the selected Package.

Thanks to this one can easily define a *Class Diagram* displaying all the entities abstracting the fact that they might be split across components.

h2. Component Diagram


h3. Connector

You can link two ports using assembly or delegation connectors.

Assembly Connector :

h3. Composite Components

h3. Using Class

As a component :

In a component :

h3. Required and Provided Interfaces

Using ports :

Or directy on the components :
