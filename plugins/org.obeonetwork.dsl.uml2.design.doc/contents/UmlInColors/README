This project contains a UML model for UML in colors class diagram.

First make sure you are in the 'Modeling' perspective.
If the 'Modeling' perspective is not active, in the title bar select Window > 
Open Perspective > Other > Modeling.

The UMLInColors project appears in the 'Model Explorer' view.  With UML 
Designer, models are stored in a Modeling Project and composed of at least two
files:
 * the data: contains the non-graphical definition of the model elements, it is 
the model.uml file;
 * the representations: contains the graphical representations of the model 
elements, it is the representations.aird file.

You can navigate to the existing diagrams by selecting items under the 
'representations.aird' file.

For example if you double-click on representations.aird > UML Structural 
Modeling > Class Diagram > Airport Class Diagram, the example class diagram will be 
opened in a new editor.
