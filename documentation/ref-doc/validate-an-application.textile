UML Designer provides a mean to evaluate and ensure the well-formedness of the UML model. On any diagram a tool is available to launch diagram validation. Right-click on a _package_ element or on the *background* of the diagram (which is associated to a package semantic element) and select the menu _Validate diagram_ :

The validation errors and warnings are listed in the problem view and decorators are positioned on the invalid elements in the diagram.

It is also possible to launch the model validation from the _*UML Model Editor*_ :
