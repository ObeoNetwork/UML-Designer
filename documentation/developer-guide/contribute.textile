h3(#Get_source_code). Get the source code

This UML modeling environment is based on the "Sirius":https://www.eclipse.org/sirius. It is under an
Open Source license (*EPL*) and the source code is hosted on "github":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer. 
It is intended to cover most use cases behind the usage of UML, and more importantly to be reused when you apply a 
model driven approach which uses both *UML and some DSL*. Everything should integrate seamlessly  in the same environment.

To get the code just "clone":https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use the repository : 
* SSH : "git@github.com:ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer.git":git@github.com:ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer.git
* HTTPS : "https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master#":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master#

h2. Get the developer environment

An "Oomph":https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.oomph setup is provided to ease the installation of the developer environment : "UMLDesigner.setup":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/blob/master/releng/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.settings/UMLDesigner.setup

1. Download the "Oomph installer":https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer and launch it. 
2. Switch to the _Advanced mode_, and make sure your settings are ok for Github (your key is registered at Github).
3. Select Eclipse.org -> Eclipse Platform and click on _Next_.
4. Add the "UML Designer setup file":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/blob/master/releng/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.settings/UMLDesigner.setup (either download it and choose it via the file browser or copy "this link":https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/master/releng/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.settings/UMLDesigner.setup into URI field). Select the UMLDesigner *AND double-click* on it to be sure that it is listed in projects listing on the bottom. Then click _Next_. Then select where you want to install the UML Designer development environment.
5. When the installation is finished, you need to activate manually the target platform to use : releng/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.target. We use target-platforms to define explicitly plugins and features available in the build context. The same are also used to work on UML Designer in our Eclipse IDE.
6. Let's go contributing to UML Designer!
