h1(#Get_source_code). Get the source code

This UML modeling environment is based on the "Sirius":https://www.eclipse.org/sirius. It is under an
Open Source license (*EPL*) and the source code is hosted on "github":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer. 
It is intended to cover most use cases behind the usage of UML, and more importantly to be reused when you apply a 
model driven approach which uses both *UML and some DSL*. Everything should integrate seamlessly  in the same environment.

To get the code just "clone":https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use the repository : 
* SSH : "git@github.com:ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer.git":git@github.com:ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer.git
