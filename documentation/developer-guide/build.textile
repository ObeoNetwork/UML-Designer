h2. Building UML Designer update-site

UML Designer and SysML Designer are both provided as Eclipse plugins but only UML Designer is included in the *UML Designer Product*.

Youâ€™ll need Apache Maven 3 to be installed on your computer and you must have "cloned the UML Designer github repository":{{page.relativePath}}/developer-guide/contribute.html#Get_source_code on your computer.
To launch the build, go to the root of the git repository and type :

@mvn clean package@

Maven will bootstrap itself, download all the dependencies and build UML Designer. The output of the build is a p2 repository (an update site) generated here :

@packaging/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.update/target/repository@

To install it in an Eclipse installation use Help/Install New Software and point to this location.

Launching the test is not harder, just type :

@mvn clean verify@

Maven will launch the tests and give you the result. 
Code coverage is captured thanks to Jacoco.

This command builds:

h2. Building UML Designer product

We have a dedicated command for the product.

@mvn clean package -f releng/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.product.parent/pom.xml@


bq. You will retrieve product in: *packaging/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.product/target/products/*

This command build:

h2. Maven Tycho

Technically, we use Maven Tycho to build these Eclipse artifacts.

To reuse a maximum of properties and maven configurations, we have a hierarchy of parents.
All UML designer plugins/features/update-sites refers to a dedicated parent:
!{{page.relativePath}}/images/UMLDesignerMavenStructure.png!

For example, to add a new plugin org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.myplugin, add a
{% highlight XML %}
    <module>${root-path}/plugins/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.myplugin<module>
{% endhighlight %}

in org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.parent and add a `pom.xml` in your plugin with the following header:
{% highlight XML %}
    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
        <parent>
            <groupId>org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2</groupId>
            <artifactId>parent</artifactId>
            <version>4.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
           <relativePath>../../releng/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.parent</relativePath>
        </parent>
        <artifactId>org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.myplugin</artifactId>
        <packaging>eclipse-plugin</packaging>
        ...
    </project>
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Continuous integration

Two continuous integration builds exist to build UML Designer. These builds run on "Travis-ci":https://travis-ci.org/.

h3(#Build). UML-Designer build

h4. Building branches

This Travis "build": https://travis-ci.org/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/ is used to :
* generate the documentation, 
* update the gh-pages (umldesigner.org web site), 
* create the UML Designer update site and products. 

This build deploys automatically the build artifacts on "S3":http://aws.amazon.com/fr/s3/ : "http://umldesigner.s3.amazonaws.com":http://umldesigner.s3.amazonaws.co

The build is configured thanks to the "@.travis.yml@":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/blob/master/.travis.yml file.

Each time a commit is integrated on the github repository a nightly build is executed and the resulting update-site and products are deployed on s3:
http://s3.amazonaws.com/umldesigner/nightly/$BRANCH_NAME.

The build deploys in S3 @umldesigner@ bucket:
* the @repository@ folder: the UML Designer nightly update site.
* the @org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.update-nightly.zip@ : a zip of the nightly update site.
* the @bundles@ folder: the nightly products.
* the @umldesigner-xxx.tpd@: the target platform used to build the update site and products.

The deploy phase is active only for specific branches: "@master@":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master, "@5.0.x@":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/5.0.x.

The "umldesigner.org":http://www.umldesigner.org web site is also updated and deployed thanks to this build. For more details about the web site have a look to the "documentation section":{{page.relativePath}}/developer-guide/documentation.html of the developer guide.

h4. Pull-requests

When a pull request is sent, a build is automatically launched. In this case, the deploy phase and the web site updates phases are not performed. The pull request build results is directly "visible in the github interface":http://blog.travis-ci.com/2012-09-04-pull-requests-just-got-even-more-awesome/.

h3(#UI_Tests_build). UML-Designer-UI-Tests build

The Travis "UI tests build": https://travis-ci.org/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer-UI-Tests is used to launch the UI tests.
This build deploys the tests results on S3: 
http://s3.amazonaws.com/umldesigner/nightly/$BRANCH_NAME/test-results/$JOB_NUMBER.
