h1. Building UML Designer update-site

*"SysML Designer":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/SysML-Designer* extends *UML Designer* and deals with systems engineering applications.
UML Designer and SysML Designer are both provided as Eclipse plugins but only UML Designer is included in the *UML Designer Product*.

The schema below explains dependencies:

!{{page.relativePath}}/images/UmlProductDependencies.png!

You’ll need Apache Maven 3 to be installed on your computer and you must have "cloned the UML Designer github repository":{{page.relativePath}}/developer-guide/contribute.html#Get_source_code on your computer.
To launch the build, go to the root of the git repository and type :

@mvn clean package@

Maven will bootstrap itself, download all the dependencies and build UML Designer. The output of the build is a p2 repository (an update site) generated here :

@packaging/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.update/target/repository@

To install it in an Eclipse installation use Help/Install New Software and point to this location.

Launching the test is not harder, just type :

@mvn clean verify@

Maven will launch the tests and give you the result. 
Code coverage is captured thanks to Jacoco.

h1. Build a product

We have a dedicated command for the product.

@mvn clean package -f releng/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.product.parent/pom.xml@


bq. You will retrieve product in: *packaging/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.product/target/products/*

This command build:

!{{page.relativePath}}/images/UMLDesignerBuildProduct.png!

We can specify the previous UML Designer update-site:
@... -Duml-site=file:./packaging/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.update/target/repository@

h1. Maven Tycho

Technically, we use Maven Tycho (0.19.0) to build these Eclipse artifacts.

To reuse a maximum of properties and maven configurations, we have a hierarchy of parents.
All UML designer plugins/features/update-sites refers to a dedicated parent:
!{{page.relativePath}}/images/UMLDesignerMavenStructure.png!

For example, to add a new plugin org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.myplugin, add a
{% highlight XML %}
    <module>${root-path}/plugins/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.myplugin<module>
{% endhighlight %}

in org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.parent and add a `pom.xml` in your plugin with the following header:
{% highlight XML %}
    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
        <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
        <parent>
            <groupId>org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2</groupId>
            <artifactId>parent</artifactId>
            <version>4.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
           <relativePath>../../releng/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.parent</relativePath>
        </parent>
        <artifactId>org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.myplugin</artifactId>
        <packaging>eclipse-plugin</packaging>
        ...
    </project>
{% endhighlight %}

h1. Continuous integration

Four continuous integration builds exist to build UML/SysML Designer.
* The "Travis build":https://travis-ci.org/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/ is used to generate the documentation and update the gh-pages.
* The "Hudson build UML master":https://build.obeonetwork.com/hudson/job/UML—master/ is in charge of the creation of the UML Designer Update site.
* The "Hudson build UML product master":https://build.obeonetwork.com/hudson/job/UMLProduct--master/ is in charge of the creation of the UML Designer Product.
* The "Hudson build SysML master":https://build.obeonetwork.com/hudson/job/SysML--master/ is in charge of the creation of the SysML Designer Update site.
