This section describes how to start using the UML designer either from existing UML models or by creating a new one.

After installing UML Designer, cheatsheets are available in your Eclipse installation which explain how to :
* Create a new project
* Create a new diagram
* Import an existing model
* Start with the sample model
Open the "welcome page":http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fwelcome.htm to get direct links to these cheatsheets.

h1. Display & edit an existing UML model

h1(#vpselection). UML designer viewpoints

Five viewpoints are specified on the UML designer each bringing the following views:
* Dashboard
** Dashboard
* Capture
** Package hierarchy diagram
** Use case diagram
* Design
** Class diagram
** Component diagram
** Composite diagram
** Deployment diagram
** State machine diagram
** Activity diagram
** Sequence diagram
* Review
* Extend
** Profile diagram

You can select either viewpoints or all depending on your use case. Note that the __Dashboard__ is the entry point to create new diagrams. So it is advised to select at least the __Dashboard__, __Capture__ and __Design__ viewpoints.
