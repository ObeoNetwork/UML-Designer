Learn how to create a minimal working UML project that can be enriched later.

h2. Go to the 'Modeling' perspective

First make sure you are in the 'Modeling' perspective.
If the 'Modeling'perspective is not active, in the title bar select Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Other > Modeling

h2. Create the project

First, you need to create an UML Project.
In the title bar, select File > New > Project...> UML Designer > UML Project.
Enter the name of the new project and hit 'Next'.
On the next page, select 'Model' as type for the UML model root element, and then 'Finish'.

h2. Fill the UML Model

In the 'Model Explorer' view a new project was created. The project created is a complete Eclipse project, and contains :
* 'Project Dependencies', where you can add external dependencies you rely on, i.e. models you will depend on but which are stored outside of the project.
* 'xxx.uml' which is the empty semantic UML model.
* 'representations.aird' which is the top-level representation file for the project.
* Refer to the UML Designer _User Guide_ to learn how to create elements and representations.
