To install UML Designer, it is possible to:
* download a *bundle*, in this case UML designer is already installed, just unzip and run the @umldesigner@ executable.
* get UML Designer in an existing Eclipse from the "marketplace":{{page.relativePath}}/download/index.html#Marketplace or from an "update-site":{{page.relativePath}}/download/index.html#Update_Sites.
